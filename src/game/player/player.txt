    - [FREEFALL] on Falling Puyo:
        Gravity initialization
            * Pair split takes 2 frames to complete if the main puyo should free-fall,
            * or 3 frames if it is the slave puyo. Technically, from the frame the pair
            * is detected as being blocked, a single frame passes without anything happening,
            * then the main puyo may begin its fall on the second frame after the blocking
            * event. The slave puyo may not begin its fall before the third frame.
        Freefall
        * When the gravity routine detects that the puyo has reached the floor, execution
        yields once again, calling the placement routine on the very next frame after
        free-fall. Both callbacks mark their respective object for cleanup and call the routine
        which will place the puyo on the virtual board representation in RAM.

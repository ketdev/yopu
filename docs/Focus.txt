Language: C++
    C++ is considered the standard for serious game development
    One of my favourite languages anyways
    (JS/Typescript) - Not serious, might be quicker for a POC
    (C#) - Nice alternative to C++, and has Unity, (a big maybe)

Framework: SDL
    SDL - for quick small games, less overhead + can compile to WebAssembly without huge loading screen
    Unity (C#) - Most popular entry level, but has its own ecosystem, is very different from other engines and frameworks.
    Unreal (C++) - Might be the next used platform if sticking with C++
